- It indicates that the tag be rendered as a child of the parent view that uses this component.
- **It provides access from within the component class to the ElementRef object for the tag that has the test template reference variable.**
- It makes the tag visible in the final render. If @ViewChild was not used in the class, then Angular would automatically hide the tag that has #test on it.

}`

- **It is adding the CSS class named highlighted to any DOM element that has the appHighlight attribute on it.**

## Coding Challenge
### Create a Component Driven by Inputs
#### Challenge Description
In this challenge, let's create a movie item component that receives Movie information as an input.

##### Requirements
- Open src/movie-item/movie-item.component.ts
- Add a required input of type Movie (see sample movie provided in src/app.component.ts)
- Update the provided HTML template to render the movie:
- - Title
- - Release date (no formatting needed)
- - Budget ($ {value} million - for instance: $ 50 million)
- - Duration ({value} min - for instance: 152 min)
- Update src/app.component.html to pass the sample movie as an input
- Ensure your component is displayed properly on the screen
- - üí° HINT: Review our self-study content if you get stuck at any step

##### Other Considerations
- If you see the data-test attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- Mini.css is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not required)

##### Example of Finished Component
This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If you‚Äôd like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.

## Coding Challenge
### Display a List of Components
#### Challenge Description
In this challenge, we display multiple instances of our MovieItemComponent.

##### Requirements
- Inject MoviesService into the AppComponent
- - üí° HINT: Review our self-study content on dependency injection if you're stuck here

- Retrieve a Signal of all movies from that service.
- Use the @for block to repeat MovieItemComponent as many times as needed
- - üí° HINT: Feel free to remove any code that isn't needed anymore in your components

##### Other Considerations
- If you see the data-test attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- Mini.css is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles (not required)

##### Example of Finished Application
This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If you‚Äôd like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.

## Coding Challenge
### Highlight a Specific Movie in the List on Mouse Over
#### Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to highlight movies on mouse over by changing their background color to gold. We want to use a custom directive to do so.

##### Requirements
- Edit the provided src/highlight.directive.ts
- Add a way for the directive to add the CSS class highlight to its host element on mouse over (such CSS class is already defined in styles.css)
- - üí° HINT: Review our self-study content on host bindings and host listeners

- Add a way for the directive to remove the CSS class highglight from its host element on mouse out
- Apply the directive on your MovieItemComponent

##### Other Considerations
- If you see the data-test attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

##### Example of Finished Application
This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If you‚Äôd like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.

## Coding Challenge
### Create Pipes to Improve Budget and Duration Formatting
#### Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to display movie budgets as follows using a custom pipe:

- If the budget is "175", render it as "$175 million"
- If the budget is a range such as "175-200", render it as "$175 to $200 million"
- Then create another custom pipe to format the movie duration so that "92" is displayed as "1h 32min"

##### Requirements
- Edit the provided src/pipes/million-dollar.pipe.ts
- Implement the transform method to format input values as defined in the challenge description:
- - If the budget is "175", render it as "$175 million"
- - If the budget is a range such as "175-200", render it as "$175 to $200 million"
- - üí° HINT: Not sure how to parse strings in Javascript? Take a look at string.split()

- Add your pipe to the template of movie-item.component.ts and ensure the movie budgets are displayed as required
- Edit the provided src/pipes/min-to-duration.pipe.ts
- Implement the transform method to format input values as defined in the challenge description:
- - "92" must be displayed as "1h 32min"
- Add your pipe to the template of movie-item.component.ts and ensure the movie durations are displayed as required
- - üí° HINT: This challenge can make use of a lot of modern Javascript features covered in the Javascript section of our training (template strings, ?? operator, and more)

##### Other Considerations
- If you see the data-test attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

##### Example of Finished Application
This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If you‚Äôd like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
